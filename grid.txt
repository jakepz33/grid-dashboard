BODY and HTML sizing
body:
     - min-height: 90vh; /*set min height for body to allow for grow
     - not setting width - could cause horizontal scroll bar.
     - if you want to set body as a smaller container, you can set a max
     width value on the body.

html:
    - no sizing added to html as it naturally fills 100vh and vw

Media Querires

    when screen is 768 or lower
- @ media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {} - applied when screen greater than

- Common breakpoints: 480, 768, 1024, and 1280px

- Design for Mobile first, instead of changing styles when width gets smaller that 
    768px, we should change when the width gets larger that 768px.
